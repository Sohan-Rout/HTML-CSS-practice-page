                    <p class="about">Bitcoin is a digital currency which operates free of any central control or the oversight of banks or governments. Instead it relies on peer-to-peer software and cryptography.</p>

                    <br>

                    <p class="about">A public ledger records all bitcoin transactions and copies are held on servers around the world. Anyone with a spare computer can set up one of these servers, known as a node. Consensus on who owns which coins is reached cryptographically across these nodes rather than relying on a central source of trust like a bank.</p>

                    <br>

                    <p class="about">Every transaction is publicly broadcast to the network and shared from node to node. Every ten minutes or so these transactions are collected together by miners into a group called a block and added permanently to the blockchain. This is the definitive account book of bitcoin.</p>

                    <br>

                    <p class="about">In much the same way you would keep traditional coins in a physical wallet, virtual currencies are held in digital wallets and can be accessed from client software or a range of online and hardware tools.</p>

                    <br>

                    <p class="about">Bitcoins can currently be subdivided by seven decimal places: a thousandth of a bitcoin is known as a milli and a hundred millionth of a bitcoin is known as a satoshi.</p>

                    <br>

                    <p class="about">In truth there is no such thing as a bitcoin or a wallet, just agreement among the network about ownership of a coin. A private key is used to prove ownership of funds to the network when making a transaction. A person could simply memorise their private key and need nothing else to retrieve or spend their virtual cash, a concept which is known as a “brain wallet”.</p>

                <hr>

                <article>
                    <p class="safe">The cryptography behind bitcoin is based on the SHA-256 algorithm designed by the US National Security Agency. Cracking this is, for all intents and purposes, impossible as there are more possible private keys that would have to be tested (2256) than there are atoms in the universe </p>

                    <br>

                    <p class="safe">There have been several high profile cases of bitcoin exchanges being hacked and funds being stolen, but these services invariably stored the digital currency on behalf of customers. What was hacked in these cases was the website and not the bitcoin network.</p>

                    <br>

                    <p class="safe">In theory if an attacker could control more than half of all the bitcoin nodes in existence then they could create a consensus that they owned all bitcoin, and embed that into the blockchain. But as the number of nodes grows this becomes less practical.</p>

                    <br>

                    <p class="safe">A realistic problem is that bitcoin operates without any central authority. Because of this, anyone making an error with a transaction on their wallet has no recourse. If you accidentally send bitcoins to the wrong person or lose your password there is nobody to turn to.</p>

                    <br>

                    <p class="safe">Of course, the eventual arrival of practical quantum computing could break it all. Much cryptography relies on mathematical calculations that are extremely hard for current computers to do, but quantum computers work very differently and may be able to execute them in a fraction of a second.</p>

                <h2>How to mine Bitcoin :</h2>
                <hr>

                <article>
                    <p class="mine">A variety of hardware and software can be used to mine bitcoin. When the Bitcoin blockchain was first released, it was possible to mine it competitively on a personal computer. However, as it became more popular, more miners joined the network, which lowered the chances of being the one to solve the hash.</p>

                    <br>

                    <p class="mine">You can still use your personal computer as a miner if it has newer hardware, but the chances of solving a hash individually using a home computer are minuscule.</p>

                    <br>

                    <p class="mine">This is because you're competing with a network of miners that generate around 600 quintillion hashes (as of May 15, 2024) per second. Machines—called Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) built specifically for mining—can generate more than 400 trillion hashes per second. In contrast, a computer with the latest hardware hashes around 100 megahashes per second (100 million).</p>

                <h2>How to buy Bitcoin :</h2>
                <hr>

                <article>
                    <p class="buy">If you don't want to mine bitcoin, you can buy it using a cryptocurrency exchange. Most people will be unable to purchase an entire BTC because of its price, but you can buy portions of one BTC on these exchanges in fiat currency, such as U.S. dollars. For example binance, coinbase etc.</p>
